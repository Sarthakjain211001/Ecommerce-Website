Used google fonts. Urbanist.
Select all the styles from the urbanist. Then copy the link from the right column and paste it in the index.html in the public folder.
Then copy the thing below the link from the right column and paste it in the index.css in the src folder. 

Create a pages folder. 
Create Home.js in it. 
.jsx and .js files have no difference in them. It is just for visual classification .. nothing more than this.

Styled Components:   //Used to style our components in an easy manner
  npm i styled-components

  const Container = styled.div`   //It means that Container will be a div having the style written in back ticks.
     height : 30px ;              //write css here
  `

Flexbox - (Used to make the items horizontal)
  display : flex 
  align-items: center  //For making the items come to center vertically
  justify-content: center    //For making the items come to center horizontally

Used material ui for icons - 
  In terminal : npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icon
  Go the material UI website ..There searfch the icon. Copy it's name and paste it in our project. It will get imported.
  When we write <Search   then it automatically detects <Search/> from material ui and imports it.
  
Slide is the flex box. Insite it are image containers(items in flex). ANd inside image container is the image 
ImgConatiner has height of 100%. So the imag containers are placed inside flex box(Slide) as covering the whole length vertically of the flex box. 

Using useState hook for changing the value in translateX() when we click on arrow buttons

Made data.js and kept the data of the slider in it and imported data from data.js in slider.jsx . 
Used map method on SliderItems Array to traverse the array and display the data.

To bring two things one above the another then use posiotion: absolute.
To bring the low thing on top og the top one then use z-index (i.e move the item in front in z axis.)
